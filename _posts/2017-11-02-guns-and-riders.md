"Guns & Riders" is a fast-paced arcade style game for the Nintendo Gameboy. You're the sheriff and the town has been overrun by outlaws! Take out as many as you can, but don't let any slip past you or you'll lose a life. Also, keep track of your ammo because you can only reload so fast!

Cartridge with label and protective case is included. No box or manual is included.

I will ship to the address entered on the PayPal checkout page, so please double check to make sure it’s correct.

By purchasing, you are acknowledging that you've read and understand this page as well as my [FAQ](/faq) page.
