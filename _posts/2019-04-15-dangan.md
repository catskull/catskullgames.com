This game utilizes an all-new MBC5 cartridge design. All components are new (not recycled from old games), 5 volt tolerant, and not simply reflashed bootleg carts.

It's recommended that you [read the manual](/public/images/dangan/manual.pdf) before playing the game (don't worry it's short and to the point). Also keep in mind that the game was made to be somewhat hard (but fair) and it may therefore not appeal to a casual audience.

Cartridge with label and protective case is included. No box or manual is included.

$5 of every sale will be donated to [World Animal Protection](https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/).

I will ship to the address entered on the PayPal checkout page, so please double check to make sure it’s correct.

By purchasing, you are acknowledging that you've read and understand this page as well as my [FAQ](/faq) page.
