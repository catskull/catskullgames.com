## Details:

>An evil glactic empire has constructed a moon-sized battle station = the Death Planet.
>
>Equipped with a giant laser cannon, it has the power to destroy entire planets. The whole galaxy is under threat.
>
>But the battle station has a weakness built=in at it's very core, and this has come to the knowledge of the rebel alliance.
>
>A rebel fighter squadron is on a sabotage mission to destroy the Death Planet and restore peace to the galaxy.

From Mackerel Interactive comes quite possibly the first game for the original Gameboy system with 3D graphics that is actually fun to play! Navigate the corridor and avoid the obsticals to take down the evil empire.
