>"In 1615, the ancient temple of Khai Quoc, situated on the banks of the Red River, is gravely threatened by shoreline erosion.
>
>The monks have to save the temple by moving it to safe ground on the other side of the river, where there are two locations stable enough to hold the temple tower.
>
>They can only move the temple one story at a time, and larger stories can never be placed on top of smaller ones. It is a challenge of epic proportions."
