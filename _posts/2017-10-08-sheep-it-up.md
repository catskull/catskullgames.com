## Details:

"Sheep it up!" is a one-button arcade game where a sheep has to climb up by hanging himself to flying velcro straps. The concept is simple, but the game rapidly gets quite challenging!
How high can you climb without falling down?

Cartridge with label and protective case is included. No box or manual is included.
