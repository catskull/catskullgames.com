 - 3 In=game songs (plus 1 title song)
 - 2 player head to head with link cable (not included)

Developed by and published with permission from [Jonas Fischbach](https://the-green-screen.com/278-2/#welcome). This is the first game published on Catskull Games to utilize an all-new MBC5 cartridge design. All components are new (not recycled from old games), 5 volt tolerant, and not simply reflashed bootleg carts.

Cartridge with label and protective case is included. No box or manual is included.

I will ship to the address entered on the PayPal checkout page, so please double check to make sure it’s correct.

By purchasing, you are acknowledging that you've read and understand this page as well as my [FAQ](/faq) page.
