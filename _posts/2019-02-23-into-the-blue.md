## Details:

Work fast to keep the rising panels from flying too close to the sun! Swap panels and get three or more in a row to clear the play field. Relax and see how far you can go, and when you master, link up with a friend and go head to head!

 - 9 Speed levels
 - 3 Difficulty levels
 - 3 In=game songs (plus 1 title song)
 - 2 player head to head with link cable (not included)

Developed by and published with permission from [Jonas Fischbach](https://the-green-screen.com/278-2/#welcome). This is the first game published on Catskull Games to utilize an all-new MBC5 cartridge design. All components are new (not recycled from old games), 5 volt tolerant, and not simply reflashed bootleg carts.

Cartridge with label and protective case is included. No box or manual is included.
