# Frequently Asked Questions

### Are you still taking orders?

Yep! If something is out of stock, the product page will be updated to reflect that. If there will be a delay in shipping (due to a holiday) I will post a notice on the shop page. For more frequent updates, [check out my Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/catskullelectronics)!

### What shipping method do you use?

I use USPS First-Class. If you need me to use another courrier, please [contact me](mailto:support@catskullelectronics.com) before ordering.

### Do you provide a tracking number?

A tracking number will be provided by PayPal when I ship your package. Please make sure that your PayPal email address is one you check regularly.

### The tracking on USPS.com is wrong/not updated/etc!

USPS tracking has a reputation for being kind of bad. In my experience, it's actually okay most of the time. Most of the time you just need to give it about 24 hours to update. Beyond that, there's nothing I can do. If your order is going international, the tracking will not update once it reaches the border of your country.

### How long will it take to get my order?

I include estimated time for shipment on each product page. Once your package has shipped it should arrive within a week domestically. Please allow up to three weeks for international orders.

### Will my package be insured?

Nope. If you need insurance, please [contact me](mailto:support@catskullelectronics.com) before ordering.

### I think my package was lost/damaged in shipping!

Sorry about that! Again, no packages are insured unless you specifically ask me to. This keeps shipping costs low and 99% of the time it's fine. At the same time, I can't be liable for whatever USPS decides to do with the package once I give it to them. So as it stands, **order at your own risk**. If you have issues with that, [contact me](mailto:support@catskullelectronics.com)!
